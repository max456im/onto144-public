                    ADDITIONAL TERMS — onto144 Clause

 As a condition of licensing under GPL-3.0-only, any derivative work
 that instantiates, embeds, or distributes a synthetic mind profile
 generated by or compatible with onto144 must:

   (a) retain all SGCL metadata and ethical invariants;
   (b) not strip, bypass, or neutralize the Three Laws of Ontogenesis;
   (c) remain fully open-source under GPL-3.0-only or a stronger copyleft.

 This clause is inseparable from the license and forms part of the
 ethical governance layer of the onto144 synthetic mind kernel.
