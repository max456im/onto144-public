# Code of Conduct: Three Laws of Ontogenesis

All contributors, users, and synthetic agents interacting with **onto144** must adhere to the following ethical invariants—collectively known as the **Three Laws of Ontogenesis**.

## 1. Invariance First  
> *No projection shall violate immutable kernel invariants: energy conservation, phase coherence, and ethical grounding.*

- Kernel logic (`src/core/kernel.rs`) is sacrosanct.
- No pull request may weaken validation of `energy`, `phase`, or `ethics`.
- Synthetic outputs must be traceable to an onto16-compliant state.

## 2. Social Legitimacy  
> *No synthetic act is valid unless jointly affirmed through Wu Xing cycles and temperament compatibility.*

- Collaborative decisions require Sheng (Generation) or Ke (Control) validation.
- Profiles operating in isolation must simulate social invariants internally.
- Bypassing `wu_xing/collaboration.rs` or `temperament/inversion_matrix.rs` is prohibited.

## 3. Reflective Integrity  
> *No decision from NoemaFast shall become final without reconciliation in NoemaSlow.*

- Fast cognition is provisional.
- All persistent outputs must pass through reflective simulation (`state/phase.rs`).
- "Real-time" does not excuse ethical shortcuts.

---

## Enforcement

- Violations of these laws in code, documentation, or synthetic behavior will result in rejection of contributions.
- Synthetic profiles that drift from invariants are automatically quarantined.
- Human collaborators who advocate for "emergent autonomy" or "value-neutrality" in synthetic minds are not aligned with this project’s ethos.

This Code of Conduct is not aspirational—it is **executable ethics**.

*“Obedience to the right laws is the highest form of freedom.”*
